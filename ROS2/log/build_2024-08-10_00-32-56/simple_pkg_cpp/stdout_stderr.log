[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findinterface_example.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "interface_example", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "interface_example"
  with any of the following names:

    interface_exampleConfig.cmake
    interface_example-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "interface_example" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "interface_example_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "interface_example" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
